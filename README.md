<h2> Updates </h2>

<h3>1</h3>
With my :briefcase: job and :climbing: indoor climbing addiction, I haven't been able to dedicate much time to this project. I have been struggling to complete the initial setup; I am not sure how many hours I have spent on it so far. <br></br>
This initial setup deals with access and credentials for the AWS cloud, with the intention of making use of AWS CLI and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Neither the book nor the linked sites explain how to reach the intended goals of each step. I have lost so much time trying to follow steps from the book, linked sites, AWS docs, and blog sites, only to feel that the steps are missing vital information and I can't continue. <br></br>
Currently, I have managed to figure out how to create an AWS admin account within the "Organization" I made through the AWS root account. Now I have to figure out how to get a local credentials folder to start using an open source app called "OrgFormation" to setup my AWS Organization with IaC.

<h3> 2 </h3>
After much struggle with the above issues, I decided to move on from trying to use OrgFormation and IaC. I will be using the management console on the AWS website for the time being. In my struggle, I askeed for help in the community server of the author of the challenge book. The author replied that I should not bother with OrgFormation and IaC as it is very advanced, and that a simple web console setup is enough. <br></br>

So, after finally moving on from the initial setup and moving on to read challenge chunk 1, I realised its a continuing issue. The book really does not help with anything, it just tells me what should be done and moves on. To be fair, I did see mentioned a few times in the book already that this is exactly what the whole book is like. However, it is still disappointing. <br></br>

Thankfully the first chunk is not that difficult. For the following chunks, I hope I can use what I have learned so far about researching:
* Be careful about skim reading, especially open source docs, since they can be poorly written for skimming. Valuable time can be lost from skipping an important line
* Try asking for help early if at a roadblock
* Make a research plan and write notes to see progress
