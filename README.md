<h3>1</h3>
With my :briefcase: job and :climbing: indoor climbing addiction, I haven't been able to dedicate much time to this project. I have been struggling to complete the initial setup; I am not sure how many hours I have spent on it so far. <br></br>
This initial setup deals with access and credentials for the AWS cloud, with the intention of making use of AWS CLI and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Neither the book nor the linked sites explain how to reach the intended goals of each step. I have lost so much time trying to follow steps from the book, linked sites, aws docs, and blog sites, only to find that the steps are missing vital information and I can't continue. <br></br>
Currently, I have managed to figure out how to create an AWS admin account within the "Organization" I made through the AWS root account. Now I have to figure out how to get a local credentials folder to start using an open source app called "OrgFormation" to setup my AWS Organization with IaC.

<h3> Currently </h3>
Placed on hold currently for short holiday.
